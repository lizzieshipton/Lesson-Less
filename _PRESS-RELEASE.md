There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Lesson Less

## Sub-Heading ##
  A score manager for freelance music teachers and their students.

## Summary ##
  Before I was a kickass MakerSquare student, I was a freelance private music teacher,
  and I know full well the frustrations that can arise when trying to get your students
  to practice regularly. Every tutor and teacher knows that the key to success is consistent,
  dedicated study - and every teacher has met that disorganized ten-year-old who
  just can't keep track of their papers. Copying all that music gets expensive! What if
  there was a simple tool that could help you and your students stay on top of assignments?

## Problem ##
  How often have you given your student a binder or notebook to write down weekly
  homework assignments - only to hear the following week that they immediately
  lost it, or forgot to bring it with them? Are you tired of wasting money on copies,
  and finding sheet music crumpled and forgotten in the bottom of backpacks?

## Solution ##
  Lesson Less provides an easy interface for teachers to organize and assign
  weekly study material, and for students to quickly access that material after they
  leave a lesson. Teachers can assign a piece of music from their personal database,
  and students can easily view their assignments each week.

## Quote from You ##
  'Lesson Less - because kids are disorganized.'

## How to Get Started ##
  To get started, simply go to lessonless.herokuapp.com and click either 'teacher'
  or 'student'.

## Customer Quote ##
  'My son's backpack used to be a mess of crumpled papers and half-complete assignments.
  At least his music is organized - he just logs in to the app, and all his scores
  are right there!'
