# Lesson Less

## A score manager for freelance music teachers and their students.

## Summary ##
  Before I was a kickass MakerSquare student, I was a freelance private music teacher,
  and I know full well the frustrations that can arise when trying to get your students
  to practice regularly. Every tutor and teacher knows that the key to success is consistent,
  dedicated study - and every teacher has met that disorganized ten-year-old who
  just can't keep track of their papers. Copying all that music gets expensive! What if
  there was a simple tool that could help you and your students stay on top of assignments?

## Problem ##
  How often have you given your student a binder or notebook to write down weekly
  homework assignments - only to hear the following week that they immediately
  lost it, or forgot to bring it with them? Are you tired of wasting money on copies,
  and finding sheet music crumpled and forgotten in the bottom of backpacks?

## Solution ##
  Lesson Less provides an easy interface for teachers to organize and assign
  weekly study material, and for students to quickly access that material after they
  leave a lesson. Teachers can assign a piece of music from their personal database,
  and students can easily view their assignments each week.

## Quote from You ##

## Customer Quote ##
  'My son's backpack used to be a mess of crumpled papers and half-complete assignments.
  At least his music is organized - he just logs in to the app, and all his scores
  are right there!'
